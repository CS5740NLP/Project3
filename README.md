# Project3
SQuAD system
This project is to design a SQuAD system. 

The first part is to build a baseline and evalute its performance, then make a propsal to the whole project.
baseline 1 is random guess implementation and baseline 2 is string similarity metrics implementation

The alternative design is using feature extraction idea to extract : TFIDF of matching word frequency, TFIDF of span word frequency and last one is length like what introduced in critique 3 paper.

The predicted result of alternative design files are dev_prediction_v3.json and tst_prediction_v3.json, the feature extraction cost an unparalleled huge time cost!

also we uploaded the previous first trial method : neural network design which failed in the end in this repo.
